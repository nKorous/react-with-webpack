# React App (custom build implementation, no create-react-app)

This empty app is built without create-react-app so that I can understand more
what goes into setting up an app structure without all of the stuff done for
me. It is kind of a pain but now at least i know what i need to do to set one
up from scratch. 


**_May use this as a blank 'starting template' for future React products._**
